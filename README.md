# Text Editor

This is a way for me to excercise my programming as well as create a text editor I want to use.

Apps like Sublime or Atom work fine but they lack certain aspects that I want in a text editor.

## Features In The Future

+ Aesthetic parsing of text for markdown support.
    - Words between `** **` will look bolded (etc)
+ Themes
    - Hopefully a dark one. I hate working with a bright light
+ "Code Folding"
    - Bring this not just to code but for writing long form. 
    - This will also include the ability to 'point' to another document to reduce clutter. But when the document is fully exported, all documents pointed to will be referenced to create the final export
